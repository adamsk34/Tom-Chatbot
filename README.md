# Tom-Chatbot
Simple chatbot

Tom is the name of this chatbot, he is still in development. Tom stands for T.erminal O.perations um...
no no no. Tom stands for T.errifying O.mni...something.
No, I got it! Tom stands for T.alking O.mnipurpose M.achine...

Okay fine, the name doesn't mean anything. I just thought it fit his unique personality. Are you happy?
He is written in Java, I used the IDE called DrJava. He is a bit rough around the edges but he will one
day be something great.

He understands a number of simple statements such as:
"how are you doing today?"
"my name is Kevin"
"I go to school at the University of Manitoba"
"My dad isn't feeling very well"

Tom has a model of the world which he will look to when answering a question. If you ask "how are you
doing today?", Tom looks to his model of the world and tells you what it says his mood is. It is set to
7/10 by default.

Tom's model of the world may update if the user gives him new information. If you tell him your name he
will write that in the world model. If you say "My dad isn't feeling very well", he will learn that you
have a father and set his mood to 3/10.

When Tom learns new things he may also ask related questions. So when Tom learns that you have a
father, Tom will respond with "What is he name?" (his grammer isn't great). Eventually Tom will run out
of questions to ask and the conversation pretty much ends unless he thinks of more questions or you
choose to ask him one.

By default Tom writes in his world model that he likes you and that the two of you are friends. Which I
think is very cute.

Using proper punctuation helps him understand what you are saying but it isn't always necessary.

Tom can only process one thing being said at a time. If you say "I am fine, how are you?", Tom will
only be able to process one of those two statements. This is a serious problem but will change soon.

I included a transcript of a real conversation I had with Tom. You can see that the conversation flow
is a bit unnatural but not awful. You can see me tell him things and then quiz him on whether or not
he remembered. Many chatbots don't have a memory like Tom does. Many chatbots can't even remember the
user's or their own name for that matter.
